Games can help inspire curiosity, optimism, and problem-solving, which are crucial in the collective impact to address
 climate change.

Our game engages players in exploring and creating scenarios of how climate change can impact different aspect of life,
including CO2 emission, rainwater/precipitation, temperature/heatwaves. Through the game, players can explore potential climate
changed futures. More importantly, how players can reduce carbon footprint by making informed choices and taking actions.

factors:
cars, trains, bikes
factories/industries plants, offices




Final improving ideas: Collaborate with climate change organizations: Partner with climate change organizations and
experts to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the information presented in the game. This could also help to
increase the reach and impact of the game by leveraging the networks of these organizations.
